# Assembler and VM projects from Nand To Tetris book

This project contains my implementation of two of the projects
from [Nand to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) book. 

"asm" contains two implementations of an assembler for the HACK machine: one written in ruby, which is in the root level of the directory. The second one is written in elixir, which you can find in the "easm" directory. Both of these projects are finished.


"vm" contains the work that I have done so far to implement a virtual machine as specified in the book. This is still a work in progress, and it is entirely made in elixir.
